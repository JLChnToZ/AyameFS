# AyameFS

This project aims to handle user imported indexed resource files with dependency mappings. Under the hood it stores the files using its contents' hash, which kind of similar to how git does, also it has an importer helper for importing resources recursivly (include archive files too) from somewhere else. This project is still in early stage, and it is intend to be used in [BananaBeats](https://bms.moka-rin.moe/) for indexing chart resources.
